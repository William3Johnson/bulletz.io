🎉 __Now Open Source in Celebration of 10k unique players!__ 🎉

---

[bulletz.io](https://bulletz.io) is an open source real time multiplayer 2D shooter.
The backend is written in the functional programming language Elixir.
The game runs on a custom game engine that was written with fault tolerance in mind.
Fault tolerance is achieved by leveraging erlang's OTP library to create error boundaries around each individual player, bullet, and powerup.
All engine code, logic, networking code, frontend, and backend code are custom written for [bulletz.io](https://bulletz.io).

# Infrastructure

![The complete bulletz architecture](media/bulletz_architecture.png)

The system consists of a few pieces
- [Hugo web client](https://gohugo.io/)
- Elixir Game Servers
- a server lister (currently disabled as I'm only running one server)

Game servers can run anywhere; the current live one runs on a Kubernetes cluster that I run on Google Kubernetes Engine.  

As a cost cutting mechanism Tthe servers are currently pre-emptible, so there is some down time.

# Architecture

The game consists of a Hugo backend under [`client/`](client/) and an
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) backend hosted under
[`game_server/`](game_server/).

## Frontend Architecture

Hugo is pretty bad in terms of JavaScript and TypeScript interop, so I have a
`client/js_src/` directory containing the TypeScript source, and the Hugo build
relies on the transpiled output which is output to `client/assets/js.app`.

The client is a PWA, written entirely using a custom routing framework.

Quite possibly the _worst_ decision I made in writing `bulletz.io` is to write
the entire frontend based on [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/).
I did this primarily as a learning exercise because the product I worked on at Google at
the time heavily used [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/).
Really regret it.

Truth be told, I want to refactor the frontend to be a React/TypeScript/NextJS
app.

## Backend Architecture

The backend server is a stripped down custom [Phoenix server](https://www.phoenixframework.org/).
Each entity has its own OTP entity (excluding food), module, and unique game logic.

All config is held under `game_server/game_config/`.

Every entity exists under `game_server/entities/`.

Services all exist under `game_server/services/`.

Finally, the server itself is under `game_server/socket_server`.

# Development

This section provides an overview of how to setup a local development environment for [bulletz.io](https://bulletz.io).

If you can't get the environment setup, please file an issue at https://github.com/LukeWood/bulletz.io/issues so we can improve the instructions.

## Setup/Installs

First, you'll need to install the following packages:

- NPM & NodeJS

- GNU make
- [hugo](https://gohugo.io)
- Elixir
- tmux

and run the following commands:

- `npm install -g postcss-cli`
- `npm install -g autoprefixer`
- `mix local.rebar`

---

Next, you'll need to get the frontend dependencies:

```
cd client/js_src
yarn
```

---

Next, install backend dependencies:

```
cd game_server/socket_server
mix deps.get
```

## Development Server

Running a dev server should be as easy as:
`make dev-server`

That's all!  Read below the line to see exactly what this command does:

---

`make dev-server` does the following for you:

Create a hugo server instance
`cd client && hugo server -D`

Create a webpack watcher instance
`cd client/js_src && npm run watch`

Run the backend:
`cd game_server/socket_server && MIX_ENV=dev iex -S mix phx.server`

## Make Some Changes!

Once you have a development server running, try changing the game a bit!
My recommendation is to go into `game_server/game_config/` and change a few
values.
